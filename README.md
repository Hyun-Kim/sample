##CURRENT

I am a graduate student of CiTE at POSTECH, **majoring in text mining and patent analysis**.   
Currently I am participating in 

1)  **Future Strategy Lab.** (Dept. of Industrial and Management Engineering)   
: focused on semantic text mining of patents for discovering future opportunities in business and technology.   

2)	**Knowledge & Language Engineering Lab.** (Dept. of Computer Science Engineering).    
: focused on information retrieval, especially related to web-based applications such as blog retrieval, top news story identification, and subtopic mining   

My research aims to develop Patent Analysis System using text mining techniques and natural language processing techniques. I have conducted many team project activities regarding marketing, management, and human factors engineering. Because I have learned management science and after Ph. D. course I want to set up a business helping technology consulting, this internship will be a great help to your company and me.
